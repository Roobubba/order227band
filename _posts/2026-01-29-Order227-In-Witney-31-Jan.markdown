# Gig update

## Order#227 - Witney - 31 Jan 2026 - Studio Se7en

## Update:

Due to illness, Order#227 will unfortunately *NOT* be playing at Studio Se7en this Satuday 31 Jan. Apologies to the organisers, the other bands playing, and to our supporters.
If you were planning to come and see us, please still head down to Studio Se7en for what will be a fantastic night of live music! We hope to see you all in Oxford on 31 May for [Convergence Fest]({{site.baseurl}}/2026/01/29/Order227-In-Oxford-23-May.html).
